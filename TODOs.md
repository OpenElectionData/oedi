# TODOs

- Footer pagination for pages not included in ToC (like Supplementary materials page in assessment)
- Format `:callout-exercise` in assessment pages
- Force Assessment guide link to redirect to English version
- Setup Netlify to use 11ty

## TinaCMS conversion

- Markdown footnotes do not work with Tina. Figure out workaround for this
- Change content for Assessment Forms index.md file so the nunjucks isn't showing up in the CMS
- Are there plans to publish the Assessment in languages other than English?
