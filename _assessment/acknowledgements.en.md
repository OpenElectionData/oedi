This guide was written by Julia Brothers with input from Michelle Brown, Johandra Delgado, Amanda Domingues, and Anastasia Wibawa. Jacqueline Schrag managed the online deployment of the guide, including formatting, graphics and functionality. The design and formatting of this publication was made possible by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under Award No. AID-OOA-L-15-00007 through the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening (CEPPS) in support of emerging groups in the Pacific Islands to use open election data to analyze ongoing electoral processes and promote transparency in the region. NDI would like to acknowledge the work of citizen election monitors around the globe that are embracing open election data as a key component of credible elections, and an important tool for enhancing accountability and public confidence in the democratic process.
