**Election cycle assessed:** 10 April Presidential and Parliamentary Elections, and 5 June 2011 Presidential Election Run-off.

**Political party registration:** [Peru's Registry of Political Organizations](http://190.81.186.197/srop_publico/6Consulta/con_PadronAfil.aspx) provides an extensive amount of party registration-related data and information, including user-friendly information on the laws and procedures for application, as well as a list of all parties, their status and relevant application documents. It also provides summary statistics on party membership, as well as a complete list of the names of each party's members for download in PDF. The only drawback from an open data perspective is that the data is not in an analyzable format.

**Campaign finance data for candidates:** [Peru's campaign finance data](http://www.web.onpe.gob.pe/modFondosPartidarios/gsfp2011/candidato_menu.php) stands out as a good example in the region, as it meets many open election data principles. Summary-level data on income and expenses for each candidate is available for download in analyzable but proprietary format (Excel). In addition, granular, individual expense and income data is available for download in Excel for each candidate. One drawback is that individual expense and income data is not available for download in bulk (expenditures are in a separate file from income for each candidate), which makes data analysis more difficult. An example of candidate expense and income data can be found [here](http://www.web.onpe.gob.pe/modFondosPartidarios/gsfp2011/candidato_detalle.php?t=p&a=ALIANZA%20POR%20EL%20GRAN%20CAMBIO&d=AREQUIPA).
