Election data that is "non-discriminatory" has no usage restrictions. Open data is nothing without users. Election data must be made available to any individual or organization without limitations based on user identity or intent in order to truly unleash its potential. In a practical sense, "without limitation" means that there are no application requirements or registration requirements in order to access or use the data. In addition, making data available without limitation means that users are not required to give any of their details in order to access the data. Anonymous access to the data is essential for making data open and public. If an EMB requires registration or collects user details, then the user or organization could be at risk of retaliation by the EMB.
