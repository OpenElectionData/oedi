This guide has several potential audiences and uses, for:

- those in the media who may be new to elections and who are looking to get a [better understanding of the election process](/guide/electoral-integrity/) and what kinds of data are produced during each phase of the election process;
- election monitoring organizations, civil society groups, or political parties that want to learn more about [open data principles](/guide/principles/) such as analyzable, finely-grained, or license-free and/or how they apply to the data released during elections;
- civil society organizations or media that want a framework for evaluating how "open" their country's election data truly is;
- civil society organizations that may want to advocate for making election data more open and want [examples of how data has already been made more open](/guide/country-examples/); and
- electoral management bodies (EMBs) responsible for publishing election data that want [clear, concrete definitions of open data](/guide/electoral-integrity/).
