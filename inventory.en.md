This inventory is the result of extensive research into the election data available for the most recent national elections (as of December 31, 2014) in the following Latin American countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. Each of the country-specific tables in this inventory illustrates whether or not the data relating to different stages of the election process complied with open data principles.[^1]
