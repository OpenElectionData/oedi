## General

1. Is results data centralized at the national level? If not, at what sub-national level(s) are they consolidated?
2. Are there any legal barriers preventing CSOs from accessing results data from the government?
3. Will the availability of preliminary results be any different than final/certified results?
4. Are results provided at the polling station level? If not, why not?
5. How likely is it that results may be available in multiple formats? For instances, images of results protocols as well as HTML data or spreadsheets?

## Timely

6. Is the timeline for the development of the polling station list clear and well-known?
7. Will results be made available “live” (as they are transmitted and received from polling stations)? If not, why not?
8. Are there stated reasons why results from certain polling stations would not be immediately available, for instance in the case of a recount or other challenge?

## Granularity

9. Are all the relevant pieces of information that are included on the results protocol, including votes shares by all contestants, number of invalid ballots, total number of registered voters, etc. available? If not, what data is missing?
10. Will results data clearly be linked to a unique polling station? Will additional geographic information — such as region, constituency, etc. — be included for each polling station?
11. Will results information only be disaggregated by polling station, or also include aggregate data, such as results per constituency?

## Availability

12. What is the likelihood that fully disaggregated results data will be available for free on the internet? If not, will some or any results data be available online?
13. If some data is not available on the internet, where can you find it?
14. Will any results data have to be collected in person, or can it be emailed or otherwise accessed electronically? If so, what data will have to be collected in person?
15. Do you have to pay for access to any results data?

## Completeness

16. Will data regarding all polling station results in all constituencies be made available together? Or will it be released by different constituencies and have to be consolidated?
17. If applicable, are results from “special voting” - such as postal voting, out-of-country voting, etc. - also included? If not, where would you find this information?

## Analyzable

18. In what format(s) will results data be? Is this machine readable?

## Non-Proprietary

19. Is there any proprietary information associated with results data?

## Non-Discriminatory

20. Do you have to go through any application or registration process to obtain results data?
21. Is there any reason some organizations or stakeholders would be granted access to results information but not others? If so, why?

## Licensing

22. Are there any prescribed limits to using results data that groups must adhere to? If so, what and by whom?
23. Do you have to agree to any terms of use before accessing results data? If so, what and by whom?

## Permanently Available

24. Are you able to access polling station-level results data from previous elections?
25. Will access to disaggregated results data during this election “expire” at any time?
26. What happens to results data after the outcome is certified?
